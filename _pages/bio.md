I graduated from [ENSTA Paris](https://www.ensta-paris.fr/en) with a specialization in applied mathematics in 2020. In parallel, I also graduated from [M2 Data Science of Universit√© Paris-Saclay](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/mathematiquesappliquees/fr/masters/masters/m2-data-science).

During my studies, I did a 6-month research internship under the supervision of [Philippe Naveau](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/Phocea/Pisp/visu.php?id=44&uid=naveau), at the [Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnnement](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/en/index.php). I was working on rainfall extremes clustering, by coupling Kullback-Leibler divergence and machine learning algorithms.

Before that, I also did a 3-month research internship at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/maths/), on non-parametric additive quantile regression. More specifically, it was about the statistical and computational advantages of smoothing the pinball loss. I was supervised by [Matteo Fasiolo](https://mfasiolo.github.io/).
