During my studies at ENSTA Paris, I did a 3-month research internship at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/maths/), on non-parametric additive quantile regression, and more specifically about the statistical and computational advantages of smoothing the pinball loss. I was supervised by [Matteo Fasiolo](https://mfasiolo.github.io/).
