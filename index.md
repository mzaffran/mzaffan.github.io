I am a final year student at ENSTA Paris with a specialization in applied mathematics. In parallel, I am also a student of the [M2 Data Science of Université Paris-Saclay](https://datascience-x-master-paris-saclay.fr/). Currently, I am doing a research internship under the supervision of [Philippe Naveau](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/Phocea/Pisp/visu.php?id=44&uid=naveau), at [LSCE](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/en/index.php). The subject is the clustering of rainfall extremes by coupling Kullback-Leibler divergence and machine learning algorithms.

<!-- Next year, I will start a CIFRE PhD at [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en), Ecole Polytechnique, and [EDF R&D](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/who-we-are/activities/research-and-development), Saclay, supervised by [Julie Josse](http://juliejosse.com/) and [Aymeric Dieuleveut](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~aymeric.dieuleveut/) from CMAP, and Olivier Féron and [Yannig Goude](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~goude/about.html) from EDF. The topic of this PhD will be the forecasting of electricity price on short-term markets, with a statistical learning approach. -->
