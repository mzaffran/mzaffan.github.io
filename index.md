I am a first year PhD student at [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en), Ecole Polytechnique, and [EDF R&D](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/who-we-are/activities/research-and-development), Saclay (CIFRE PhD). I am supervised by [Julie Josse](http://juliejosse.com/), from [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en), and [Aymeric Dieuleveut](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~aymeric.dieuleveut/) from CMAP, and Olivier FÃ©ron and [Yannig Goude](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~goude/about.html) from EDF. My research project is about electricity price forecasting on short-term markets, with a statistical learning approach.
